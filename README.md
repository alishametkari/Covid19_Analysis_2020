To demonstrate the state-wise Covid19 cases in india. In this project I have fetch the live data from Ministry of Health Affairs Official Website using BeautifulSoup and requests. I have done the analysis of Covid19 cases across the states of India. When we look at the figurs of cases of states we might make wrong assumtions based on highest and lowest figure but the actual scenario is different.
The dataset is taken till 12 June 10:35 PM.
I have added Population of each state and then calculated some required rates to analyse.
Then I have plotted a bar graph to visualise data for conclusion.
# Take Aways From This Project :
1. Scrapping data from website using BeautifulSoup and requests.
2. Making dataframe, calculations on columns, addinng columns, changing data type of columns using pandas
3. Plotting bar graphs using matplotlib
# Conclusion :
1. Inspite of Maharashtra having most number of confirmed cases, it have comparatively less death rate and high cure rate.
2. Inspite of Gujarat having comparatively less number of confirmed cases, it have highest infection fatality rate.
3. Inspite of Delhi having comparatively less number of confirmed cases, it have highest death rate due to covid19 and highest active cases per lakh population.
